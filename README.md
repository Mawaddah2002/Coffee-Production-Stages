🌟 COFFEE PRODUCTION STAGES 
Interactive 2D Graphics Project  

📖 Overview 
This project demonstrates the journey of coffee production, from harvesting coffee beans to brewing a delicious cup of coffee. Using 2D graphics, animations, and vibrant visuals, it presents an engaging and educational experience.  

✨ Features 
- Coffee Mill Animation: Realistic grinding process using rotation.  
- Tree Movement: Simulated motion of trees along the X-axis.  
- Interactive Magnifier: Highlights coffee beans with zooming effects.  
- Coffee Machine Animation: Pouring coffee dynamically.  
- Coffee Cart: Animates the transportation of coffee bags between stages.  

🛠️ Technologies Used 
- Programming Language: C++  
- Graphics Library: OpenGL  
- Animation Tools: Timer and Spin functions  

📋 How It Works
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mawaddah2002/coffee-production-stages.git
   ```  
2. Open the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd coffee-production-stages
   ```  
3. Compile the project using an OpenGL-compatible compiler.  
4. Run the compiled executable to start the animation.

📚 Lessons Learned
- Integrating OpenGL functions for smooth animations.  
- Effective teamwork to combine diverse components into a cohesive project.  
- Overcoming challenges in rendering complex shapes and implementing motion.  

💡 Future Enhancements
- Add more detailed animations for each coffee production stage.  
- Introduce user interactivity to control specific elements (e.g., grind speed or coffee bean selection).  
- Enhance visuals with advanced shaders for more realistic effects.
